# mc_block_color_mapper

mc_block_color_mapper's a collection of Python scripts & libraries for generating and mapping the average colors for each of the Minecraft blocks which is perfect for certain projects for Minecraft related sites, AI projects, etc.!

[blockmodel_avgs.csv](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/mc_block_color_mapper/blob/main/blockmodel_avgs.csv) was generated for 1.20.4, but you'll have to regenerate for the version you want to use if you want to use a different version.

The documentation is here: https://randomgamingdev.github.io/EzDok/#v1/%22https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomGamingDev/mc_block_color_mapper/main/documentation.dok%22/0/ <br/>
and contains the steps for how to use it and documentation for the scripts and library, with the `mapper_example.py` script acting as both a CLI version of the `blockmodel_avgs_generator.py` library and an example for how to use it!
